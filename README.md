# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 

-> This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows the user to play against the computer and see the result of the match. This project was developed using Tailwind CSS as a style framework.

## How to Play 

-> Access the iFinishndex.html file in your browser. Choose an option by clicking one of the "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" buttons. The computer will choose your move at random. See the result of the match, which will be displayed on the screen. Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game. 

### Customizing 

-> You can customize the style of the game by editing the CSS files. 

### Adding new functionality

->  You can add new functionality to the game by editing the JavaScript file.

### Final considerations

-> This game was developed as an example of how Rock, Paper, Scissors works and how to use Tailwind CSS as a style framework, and it can still be improved and expanded. This is my first project using Tailwind CSS, feel free to do whatever you want with the code!
